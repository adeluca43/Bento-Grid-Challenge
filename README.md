## My process
I began by setting up the overall layout of the cards and applying the correct colors. Next, I focused on adding the text content, followed by the provided graphics and illustrations. Once everything was in place, I refined each card individually to align as closely as possible with the original design. Breaking the project down into smaller pieces made the process much more manageable and efficient.
### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive design

### What I learned

This project helped me better understand how to build responsive layouts with CSS Grid and fine-tune positioning using Flexbox. I also practiced custom styling, and visual alignment for a pixel-perfect match.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue working on:

- Reducing white space with more advanced layout controls
- Improving image scaling across devices
- Using `clamp()` and relative units for better responsive font sizing
